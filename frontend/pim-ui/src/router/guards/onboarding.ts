/**
 * Vue Router navigation guard for onboarding gate enforcement.
 *
 * Blocks access to the PIM dashboard and all non-public routes until
 * the onboarding wizard is completed. Uses dual-layer enforcement:
 * 1. Frontend — this guard checks the Pinia onboarding store
 * 2. Backend — the store fetches fresh status from the API on each navigation
 *
 * Uses Vue Router 4 return-based pattern:
 * - Return nothing (undefined) to allow navigation
 * - Return a route location to redirect
 * - Return false to cancel navigation
 *
 * @see https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html
